TRACKER ENDPOINTS OVERVIEW
===========================

In a tracker-style system (BitTorrent-like or private tracker), the tracker is
intentionally small and opinionated. It exposes very few endpoints because every
public endpoint increases the attack surface.

This document lists the canonical tracker endpoints, their purpose, and what is
intentionally NOT exposed.


CORE TRACKER ENDPOINTS
---------------------

1. /announce  (MANDATORY)

Purpose:
- Main interaction point between peers and the tracker

Used for:
- Joining a swarm
- Keeping presence alive
- Getting peer lists
- Reporting status (started / stopped / completed)

Characteristics:
- High frequency
- Strict validation
- Heavily rate-limited
- Minimal response

HTTP Method:
- Public trackers: GET
- Secure / private trackers: POST


2. /scrape  (OPTIONAL / OFTEN DISABLED)

Purpose:
- Return swarm statistics without announcing

Example response:
- Seeders
- Leechers
- Completed count

Security risk:
- Enables swarm enumeration
- Useful for intelligence gathering by bots
- Frequently abused

Best practice:
- Disable entirely OR
- Restrict to authenticated users and cache heavily

Many private trackers remove this endpoint completely.


3. /peer/register  (PRIVATE)

Purpose:
- Initial peer identity creation

Used for:
- Generating peer_id
- Issuing peer_secret
- Binding peer to a user or account (optional)

Characteristics:
- Low frequency
- Strong authentication
- Never public

Sometimes replaced by:
- Admin-issued credentials
- Invitation-based provisioning


4. /torrent/register  (PRIVATE)

Purpose:
- Register torrents with the tracker

Used for:
- Creating torrent records
- Assigning visibility (public / private)
- Defining access-control rules

This endpoint must never be public.


5. /health or /status  (OPTIONAL)

Purpose:
- Operational monitoring
- Health checks

Typical response:
{ "status": "ok" }

Access:
- Internal only
- IP-restricted or authenticated


OPTIONAL / ADVANCED ENDPOINTS
----------------------------

6. /banlist  (INTERNAL)

Purpose:
- Used by moderation systems
- Abuse detection
- Administrative dashboards

Never exposed to peers.


7. /metrics  (INTERNAL)

Purpose:
- Monitoring and observability
- Announce rates
- Abuse patterns
- Performance metrics

Typically used by Prometheus or similar tools.


ENDPOINTS INTENTIONALLY NOT EXPOSED
----------------------------------

- User profiles
- Peer lists outside /announce
- Full swarm statistics
- Search endpoints
- Debug endpoints
- Admin APIs on the public interface

These features belong in separate systems, not the tracker.


TYPICAL REAL-WORLD LAYOUT
------------------------

Public tracker:
- /announce

Private / secure tracker:
- /announce
- /peer/register
- /torrent/register
- /health


DESIGN PRINCIPLE
----------------

If an endpoint does not directly serve swarm coordination, it should not exist
on the tracker.

Everything else belongs in:
- A web application
- An admin service
- A separate API
